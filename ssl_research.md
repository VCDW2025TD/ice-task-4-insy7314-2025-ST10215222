SSL/TLS and HTTPS: Enhancing Web Security

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are cryptographic protocols designed to secure communications over a computer network. TLS is the successor to SSL, offering improved security and efficiency. While SSL is now deprecated, the term "SSL" is still commonly used to refer to TLS certificates.

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP, utilizing SSL/TLS to encrypt data exchanged between a user's browser and a web server. This encryption ensures that sensitive information, such as passwords and credit card details, is protected from interception by malicious actors.

Failing to implement SSL/TLS in web applications exposes them to various risks, including data breaches, man-in-the-middle attacks, and non-compliance with industry regulations like PCI DSS. Such vulnerabilities can lead to significant financial losses and damage to an organization's reputation.

Real-world incidents have highlighted the consequences of missing or misconfigured SSL certificates. For instance, expired certificates have led to service outages and security breaches, underscoring the importance of proper certificate management.
